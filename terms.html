    <tr>
        <td> authenticate </td>
        <td>Authentication is a process (typically some type of protocol) by which an
entity can prove it has a specific attribute or controls a specific secret
using one or more <a>verification methods</a>. With <a>DIDs</a>, a common
example would be proving control of the private key associated with a public
key published in a
<a>DID document</a>.</td>

    <tr>
        <td> blockchain </td>
        <td>A specific type of <a>distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT) in which ledger
entries are stored in blocks of transactions that are grouped together and
hashed into a cryptographic chain. Because this type of <a>DLT</a> was
introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>, the
term <em>blockchain</em> is sometimes used to refer specifically to the Bitcoin
ledger.</td>

        <td> binding </td>
        <td>A concrete mechanism used by a caller to invoke a <a>DID resolver</a> or a

software library, or a network call such as an HTTPS request.</td>

        <td> decentralized identifier </td>
        <td>A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized
registration authority because it is generated and/or registered cryptographically.
The generic format of a DID is defined in the
<a href="https://w3.org/TR/did-core">DID Core specification</a>.
A specific <a>DID scheme</a> is defined in a <a>DID method</a> specification.
Many—but not all—DID methods make use of <a>distributed ledger technology</a>
(DLT) or some other form of decentralized network.</td>

        <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">identity
management</a> that is based on the use of <a>decentralized identifiers</a>.
Decentralized identity management extends authority for identifier generation,
registration, and assignment beyond traditional roots of trust such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500">X.500 directory services</a>,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a>,

For example, a parent who controls a child's <a>DID document</a> might permit
the child to use their personal device in order to <a>authenticate</a>. In
this case, the child is the <a>DID delegate</a>. The child's personal device
would contain the private cryptographic material enabling the child to
<a>authenticate</a> using the DID. However the child may not be permitted to
add other personal devices without the parent's permission.</td>

association with the <a>DID</a>. A DID document may also contain other

plus a set of dereferencing options, and returns a <a>resource</a>. This
resource may be a <a>DID document</a> plus additional metadata, or it may be a

        <td>verifiable timestamp</td>
        <td>A verifiable timestamp enables a third-party to verify that a data object
existed at a specific moment in time and that it has not been modified or
corrupted since that moment in time. If the data integrity could reasonably
have modified or corrupted since that moment in time, the timestamp is not
verifiable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>verification method</td>
        <td><p>
A set of parameters that can be used together with a process or protocol to
independently verify a proof. For example, a public key can be used as a
verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it
verifies that the signer possessed the associated private key.
    </p>
    <p>
"Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. For
example, a public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key exchange to
negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the integrity
of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification method,
even though descriptions of the process might not use the words "verification"
or "proof."</td>

UUIDs differ from DIDs in that they are not resolvable or
cryptographically-verifiable.</td>
